    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol class="recipe-steps">
        <li>In a large pot, bring the water or broth to a boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add the pork chunks and let it simmer for about 30 minutes or until the pork becomes tender.</li>
        <li>While the pork is cooking, prepare the tamarind by soaking the tamarind pods in warm water for a few minutes. <br>Extract the tamarind juice and discard the solids. If using tamarind paste, simply dissolve it in a cup of warm water and strain to remove any seeds or pulp.</li>
        <li>Once the pork is tender, add the tamarind juice to the pot, followed by the radishes, eggplants, string beans, tomatoes, onions, and minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Season the sinigang with fish sauce (or salt) and pepper, adjusting the amount to suit your taste preference.</li>
        <li>For those who prefer a spicier sinigang, add the sliced green chili at this point.</li>
        <li>Let the sinigang simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked but still slightly crisp.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the water spinach or spinach leaves (if using) and cook for an additional 2 minutes until the greens wilt.</li>
        <li>Taste the sinigang and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve the hot and flavorful Filipino pork sinigang in bowls, with steamed rice on the side. Enjoy this delicious and comforting soup with your family and friends!</li>
